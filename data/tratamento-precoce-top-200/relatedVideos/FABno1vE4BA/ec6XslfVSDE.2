We’ve seen the hype before with different drugs that ultimately did not pan out. For Ivermectin, the buzz started when researchers in Australia showed that in vitro, meaning in a test tube, SARS-CoV-2 replication was reduced about ~5000-fold over a 48 h time span.\nIn April, I made a video about this, and I explained how this drug is thought to inhibit viral replication. And is also widely believed to have anti-inflammatory properties. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nDoctor Mike Hansen's Programs ⏩ \nFULL Course for MORE ENERGY:\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/more-energy-course/\nFREE Course for MORE ENERGY:\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/6-days-to-more-energy/\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince April, I’ve combed thru multiple studies, as scientists worldwide have been looking at ivermectin, and so far, 14 studies have been completed. But these studies are not without their flaws. There are retrospective studies that introduce bias, and most of the studies have small numbers, and some are published as preprints before a thorough peer-review process can be completed. The benefit of pre-print studies being published is that knowledge can be quickly shared worldwide. \n\nThe hope is that prospective randomized studies will follow these observational or anecdotal studies.  The drawback is that studies are frequently published and retracted once they are more critically reviewed. For example, I was able to find 3 ivermectin pre-print studies that have since been retracted. But I need to know, should I be prescribing ivermectin for COVID? If so, at what dose and for how long? Well, in this video, I’m going to objectively break these studies down.\n\nThe gold standard for a scientific trial is a prospective study that is double-blind and randomized with a treatment and control group, and it should be well-matched in as many variables as possible to reduce the risk that unforeseen factors, and not the medication's action, are causing the effect that researchers are studying. A prospective study enrolls participants to evaluate a treatment protocol, follows them for side effects, and evaluates the results. \n\nA double-blind study is when neither the investigators nor the treatment recipients know whether they have received the treatment or a placebo. Amid a pandemic, decision-makers have been trying to balance the need for evidence-based medicine and good clinical practice with the urgent need for safe and effective treatments for COVID.\n\nAdvocates who are on the side of pushing more treatment protocols through this process, even on sub-standard clinical evidence, will argue that the death rate continues to increase and that there is not enough time to justify a full prospective study that can take months. They also note that the medications they are choosing to treat COVID have been FDA approved for other uses and are considered safe, even if they have not been tested to verify safety and efficacy for COVID. \n\nIvermectin is sold over-the-counter in many countries to treat people and animals for parasitic worm infections. In Latin America, such as Peru, Guatemala, and Bolivia, its been in great demand as people believe that it protects them from COVID. Researchers in Latin America point out that the evidence is scant that ivermectin protects against COVID. However, they have difficulty recruiting participants to run a clinical trial and test their hypothesis because nearly everyone has taken the drug. \n\nBias can lead to beliefs that become difficult to dislodge and question. For example, if people believe medication will work, it can become difficult to challenge this belief. Many will justify using unproven remedies by saying that it has a good safety profile and will not hurt even if it does not work. A zealous belief that medication will cure can lead to users ignoring side effects, a confirmation bias.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nDoctor Hansen's Courses: https://doctormikehansen.com/courses/\nContact and Social Media Links: https://doctormikehansen.com/contact/\n\n#covid #covid19 #ivermectin","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6Thfq47Hfvs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6Thfq47Hfvs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6Thfq47Hfvs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6Thfq47Hfvs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6Thfq47Hfvs/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Doctor Mike Hansen","liveBroadcastContent":"none","publishTime":"2021-01-07T20:03:10Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#searchResult","etag":"QqtjbVr7kIJo1sOW2thXm7WATPk","id":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nqNxSRcIQPY"},"snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-11-18T16:39:28Z","channelId":"UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A","title":"How Doctors Can Predict Who Dies From COVID","description":"How doctors can predict which patients are more likely to die of COVID\n\nSeveral studies have come out about the COVID prognosis. As a result, we now have a powerful way to predict which patients with COVID pneumonia are more likely to die and require longer stays in the hospital. \n\nWe already know that less than 15% of people who get COVID have a severe disease to the point of requiring hospitalization. Less than 5% of people who get coronavirus require ICU. For those with COVID pneumonia who require ICU, and for some of the other patients in the hospital who might not necessarily need ICU, these are the patients who have the cytokine storm that we keep hearing about, meaning the immune system is going haywire. There is a ton of inflammation taking place in the body….especially the lungs. But now, we have a more specific way of predicting who is more likely to develop cytokine storm, and therefore more likely to die, and who is more likely to require a longer stay in the hospital….and it's based on the bloodwork we get when patients are hospitalized.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nDoctor Mike Hansen's Programs ⏩ \nFULL Course for MORE ENERGY:\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/more-energy-course/\nFREE Course for MORE ENERGY:\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/6-days-to-more-energy/\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen we get bloodwork, we’re doing various lab tests. It is most commonly a complete blood count, CBC, and a complete metabolic panel or CMP. We often check other things like troponin, d-dimer, LDH, ferritin, and CRP.  A complete blood count is specifically looking at 3 things: hemoglobin levels, platelets, and white blood cells. We can use the total number and the breakdown of the percentages of the types of white blood cells, meaning what percentage are neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.  Lymphocytes generally make up about 15-45% of WBC. This is very important as it pertains to COVID, and you’ll see why in a little bit. \n\nThe CMP stands for the complete metabolic pan looking at sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose calcium, bilirubin, albumin, and liver enzymes like AST ALT alkaline phosphatase. Some of these also have important implications when it comes to COVID disease severity. Because In the recent study done at Temple University, they analyzed over 500 hospitalized COVID patients, all of which had inflammation in their lungs seen on a CT scan of the chest (show). They determined the criteria for COVID cytokine storm. For patients who met these criteria, their length of stay in the hospital was 15 days, compared to 6 days if they did not meet the criteria. \n\nMortality was 28.8% in the group that met the criteria, vs. 6.6% in those who did not. So if they met cytokine storm criteria, their likelihood of dying was 4 times higher. And how accurate was this prediction model? Pretty accurate, as this study had a specificity of 79% and a sensitivity of 85%, which is a lot of predictive power. Most of the patients who met the criteria for CS did so at the time of admission or shortly after. This suggests that there is an early and rapid progression in these patients and that there is a low likelihood of developing cytokine storms after 10 days of hospitalization. \n\nSo based on these specific lab parameters, this is how doctors can predict which patients are more likely to die of COVID. I find that this study correlates with what I’ve seen in my personal experience with hospitalized covid patients. And yes, the man whose CT scan I showed you earlier in this video met all of these criteria for cytokine storm, and he did so as soon as 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nDoctor Hansen's Courses: https://doctormikehansen.com/courses/\nContact and Social Media Links: https://doctormikehansen.com/contact/\n\n#covid #covid19","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqNxSRcIQPY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqNxSRcIQPY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqNxSRcIQPY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqNxSRcIQPY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqNxSRcIQPY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Doctor Mike Hansen","liveBroadcastContent":"none","publishTime":"2020-11-18T16:39:28Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#searchResult","etag":"uxPHoqB9sUssheqAl_D_7nuVbfE","id":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"GeS6W4krkuU"},"snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-06-23T13:14:23Z","channelId":"UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A","title":"Does Exercise Protect Against Severe COVID?","description":"Does Exercise Protect Against Severe COVID?\n\nUntil now, there really haven’t been any good studies directly looking at the link between exercise and the severity of COVID illness. There is a new, large study in the BMJ of Sports Medicine that did exactly that. \n\nBenefits of Exercise - Health, Physical, Mental, And Overall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WV7kAUGrgI\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nDoctor Mike Hansen's Programs ⏩ \nFULL Course for MORE ENERGY:\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/more-energy-course/\nFREE Course for MORE ENERGY:\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/6-days-to-more-energy/\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe already have a ton of research that shows us that exercise helps us feel better, mentally and physically. It prevents or improves many medical conditions, like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, certain types of cancer, dementia, and can extend our lives. That’s why the US physical activity guidelines and the American Heart Association recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity weekly. So now let's get to the study that was just done at Kaiser Permanente in California. \n\nTo understand this study, you have to know about something they were already doing before the pandemic. Health care workers there routinely asked all of their patients two simple questions about their physical activity. They would refer to this as the \"Exercise Vital Sign.\" On average, the questions were how many days per week do you engage in moderate to strenuous exercise (like a brisk walk)? The answer choices are 0 to 7 days. The second question was, on average, how many minutes do you engage in exercise at this level? The answer choices are 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150 or greater minutes.\n\nBased on research, it turns out that these questions are a good measure of people’s activity levels. Not only that, but these 2 questions predict some medical problems, such as high blood pressure and high blood sugar. Most people already know that many health conditions are strongly correlated with a lack of physical activity — like the ones I just mentioned. Many of them are also risk factors for severe illness and death if they get COVID. Like obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n\nThe researchers also looked at other important characteristics of these 48,000+ patients. How old were they? Were they male or female? Did they smoke? or have emphysema? Did they have obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, or kidney disease? And more. They collected and analyzed a ton of data, then calculated the risk correlated with different outcomes. The big takeaways from this study are that consistently inactive people had a significantly higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death after getting COVID compared with those who were active for at least 150 minutes per week.\n\nAlso, what they found was that those who were active for over 10 minutes per week, meaning group B, did have some protection against severe illness or death from COVID, but not as much as group A. Now, this was one study, looking at the direct correlation between exercise and severity of COVID illness. More studies would be needed to confirm these findings, but it's one more reason to encourage and promote physical activity for everyone based on what we have. Ideally, a minimum of 150 minutes per week. \n\nCertain types of exercise can give more health benefits than others. For example, resistance training, or strength training, which includes lifting weights and calisthenics, is especially great not just for adding muscle and staying strong but to prevent osteoporosis. Then you have HITT, which is especially great for shedding fat. Then you have aerobic training, or cardio, which is especially great for shedding fat and increasing stamina. All of these types of exercises have overlap when it comes to benefits. Now I know. Some people are going to bring up this question. How does exercise, along with healthy eating, and getting good sleep, etc., how does compare to the covid vaccine?\n\nLet’s say you exercise more than 150 minutes per week. And you don’t have the vaccine. Does that give you the same level of protection? Well, we don’t have any studies comparing the two head-ons. All I can tell you is that the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna are 95% effective against severe COVID. And I seriously doubt that exercising 150 plus minutes per week will get you that same level of protection. To do that study, you would need to do a randomized clinical trial comparing those that head-on. On that note, this new Delta variant of COVID, which is the worst COVID strain yet, is rising in the US and will soon be the dominant strain.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nCourses: https://doctormikehansen.com/courses/\nContact: https://doctormikehansen.com/contact/\n\n#covid #exercise #covid19","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeS6W4krkuU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeS6W4krkuU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeS6W4krkuU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeS6W4krkuU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GeS6W4krkuU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Doctor Mike Hansen","liveBroadcastContent":"none","publishTime":"2021-06-23T13:14:23Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#searchResult","etag":"agiqak_ZcEaRaWNdade8LrN8deQ","id":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"ha2mLz-Xdpg"},"snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-12-10T20:59:09Z","channelId":"UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ","title":"Vitamin D and COVID 19: The Evidence for Prevention and Treatment of Coronavirus (SARS CoV 2)","description":"Professor Roger Seheult, MD explains the important role Vitamin D may have in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Although less common, it also can be transmitted through aerosol, meaning airborne. Most likely, when you have people in an enclosed space, such as an elevator, someone sneezes or coughs without covering their mouths, and someone else can inhale it in. \n\nThis covid attaches to cells in our body by this ACE2 receptor. This ACE2 receptor is only located on certain cells in our body. It's on our tongue, in our nose, back of the throat, and in our lungs. Specifically, within the lungs, it's only located on our type II alveolar cells. \n\nWe know that ARDS develops in about 4 to 5% of COVID patients. And of all the people who get Coronavirus, the mortality rate is around 1 to 2% or max 3%. So why do some COVID patients get ARDS, and why do some die? There are different reasons, and let's talk about them. It could be one of these reasons, but more likely, it’s a combination of these reasons.\n\n1. The coronavirus only gains entry into our cells that express the ACE2 receptor. They are located on multiple sites. Besides being in the lung, they’re in your mouth, nose, throat, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and testes.\n\n2. It makes sense that if the virus only gets into your mouth or nose, or throat, but not the lungs, it would cause only cold-like symptoms. But if the coronavirus gets all the way down into the alveoli of your lungs, that’s what's going to cause ARDS.  And by the way, the ACE2 receptors in your gut probably explain why some patients get nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. \n\n3. The amount of virus that you get into your body likely determines how sick you get. This is what we call the viral load. \n\n4. The inflammatory reaction with COVID is extremely complicated, with many different proteins and hormones and interleukins at play. But there are several known genetic polymorphisms of these proteins that likely make some people more prone to getting worse illnesses than others. A genetic polymorphism simply means a variation on a particular gene. For example, there are genetic polymorphisms for the ACE gene, as well as IL-6. So, basically, a lot of it just comes down to our genes. \n\n5. Because the 5th reason has to do with estrogen. Estrogen is known to inhibit the effects of IL-6, which plays a huge role in this cytokine storm. This might explain why women overall have the less severe disease compared to men. \n\n6. The 6th reason is that people already taking certain medications for those on an ACEI such as lisinopril or an ARB like losartan, telmisartan, or candesartan, or irbesartan. Or people who take hydroxychloroquine for lupus or rheumatoid disease. Or people who take tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor. Are these COVID patients less prone to getting severe illnesses? My guess is yes. \n\nWant to support health care workers (with help for PPE)?\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/medical-students-for-masks-nyc-nj?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nDoctor Hansen's Courses: https://doctormikehansen.com/courses/\nContact and Social Media Links: https://doctormikehansen.com/contact/\n\n#covid #covid19","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LV8wWhjTKRU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LV8wWhjTKRU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LV8wWhjTKRU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LV8wWhjTKRU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LV8wWhjTKRU/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Doctor Mike Hansen","liveBroadcastContent":"none","publishTime":"2020-04-15T18:23:30Z"}}]}
