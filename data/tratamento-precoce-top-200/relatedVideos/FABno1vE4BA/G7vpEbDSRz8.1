Ivermectin is widely available due to its inclusion on the WHO model list of essential medicines. It opens glutamate-sensitive chloride channel currents in helminths, and it is widely believed that this is how it kills certain parasites. It's the drug of choice for the treatment of onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis. So why might Ivermectin work against COVID?\n\nOnce the virus gains entry into the body's cells, using the ACE2 receptor, the virus releases its messenger RNA into the cell. Then, the cell starts to translate the mRNA from the virus, which starts to make viral proteins, and that‚Äôs how the new virus forms. \n\nSome of these viral proteins that are freshly made then enter into the cell's nucleus, or are at least thought to do so by many scientists, which probably impairs our cells' ability to fight off the infection. These viral proteins are thought to gain entry into our cells' nucleus through specific channels of a different protein, called importin. Not important, importin. There's importin type alpha, importin beta. Or Imp for short, so imp alpha, imp beta. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nDoctor Mike Hansen's Programs ‚è© \nFULL Course for MORE ENERGY:\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/more-energy-course/\nFREE Course for MORE ENERGY:\nhttps://doctormikehansen.com/6-days-to-more-energy/\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd this is where ivermectin comes in because ivermectin inhibits the passage of these viral proteins into the nucleus. It does so by binding to these protein channels and effectively blocking the transport of molecules through them. So this is why scientists started studying ivermectin. And this recent article that just came out on April 3rd in the journal Antiviral Research.  This is a pre-proof article, meaning they have been peer-reviewed, but the final publication is still pending. These scientists found that ivermectin significantly inhibits the COVID viral proteins in their passage from the cytoplasm into the nucleus of cells in vitro.\n\nIn vitro means, this was done in a test tube or outside of a living organism. \nA single dose of Ivermectin had ‚àºa 5000-fold reduction in virus levels at 48h in cell culture. So this drug has a huge impact on this virus in vitro. And that is why the authors of this study conclude that these drugs need to be studied in COVID patients, meaning in clinical trials. Other drugs are being looked at in clinical trials for COVID, such as redeliver, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. \n\nBecause Ivermectin is generally considered a safe drug and is already FDA approved for other diseases, it can be repurposed for COVID as long as it is safe and effective for COVID patients in clinical trials. \n\nIf this drug turns out to be the miracle drug for Covid, the next question will become, when should people start taking it? \nBecause the patients with COVID who get very sick usually get sick very quickly. So this ivermectin may have to be given prophylactically or at the first onset of symptoms. \n\nThe other question is, what are the side effects or adverse reactions? \nWell, base on what we already know about ivermectin, this is what I can tell you. \nThe most common adverse reaction is the Mazzotti reaction. But this only happens when ivermectin is used to treat onchocerciasis, a parasitic infection. The Mazzotti reaction was first described in 1948. It‚Äôs a symptom complex seen in patients after undergoing treatment of nematode infestation, particularly with the medication diethylcarbamazine (DEC), but with ivermectin. \n\nMazzotti reactions can be life-threatening and are characterized by fever, hives, generalized swelling, swollen lymph nodes, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, hypotension, joint pain, and abdominal pain.\n\nThere is a 25% chance of Mazzotti reaction when ivermectin is used to treat onchocerciasis, not other parasitic infections. So if a COVID patient took ivermectin, this would not happen. \n\nSo, otherwise, Ivermectin is very safe, and side effects are uncommon. However, diarrhea occurs in 2% of people taking it. \n\nAlso, Ivermectin should not be administered to pregnant or lactating women, and its safety in children less than 15 kg is unknown.\n\nDoctor Mike Hansen, MD\nInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine\nWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/\nDoctor Hansen's Courses: https://doctormikehansen.com/courses/\nContact and Social Media Links: https://doctormikehansen.com/contact/\n\n#covid #covid19 #ivermectin","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ec6XslfVSDE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ec6XslfVSDE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ec6XslfVSDE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ec6XslfVSDE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ec6XslfVSDE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Doctor Mike Hansen","liveBroadcastContent":"none","publishTime":"2020-04-09T19:51:31Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#searchResult","etag":"cb-xQLqU4wEp_f6inHX7fYz-b_0","id":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"eiyAzAWSQmU"},"snippet":{"publishedAt":"2020-04-10T17:28:03Z","channelId":"UCb5h4h3xQ5RjgVNb6JlMWWA","title":"Profilaxia medicamentosa e Coronav√≠rus.","description":"Infectologista e especialista em Sa√∫de P√∫blica","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiyAzAWSQmU/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiyAzAWSQmU/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiyAzAWSQmU/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiyAzAWSQmU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"channelTitle":"Profa.
